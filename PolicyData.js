Zoning reform is like changing the rules so you can use more types of Lego pieces in more areas of the board, allowing you to build a more diverse and efficient city."

            analogy: "Imagine a neighborhood where many families have lived for decades. With a Land Value Tax:

1. If you decide to renovate your kitchen or add a room to your house, your tax bill wouldn't go up. You're not penalized for improving your home.

2. If your neighbor builds a brand new house, it doesn't mean your taxes will increase. You're not punished because the area is changing around you.

3. If you've lived in your home for 40 years and the neighborhood has become more desirable, your tax bill is the same as a newcomer with a similar plot of land. Long-term residents aren't pushed out by rising taxes.

It's like paying for the spot your home sits on, not the home itself. This way, you're free to improve your home without worrying about a tax hike, and you're not pressured to move just because your neighborhood is changing."
